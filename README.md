# $${\color{red}MIT}$$  $${\color{red}FrED}$$
Code for the Fiber Extrusion Device's Raspberry Pi
## Setup
Open a terminal in the Raspberry Pi (`Ctrl + Alt + T`) and type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-fredfactory/fred-device.git
cd fred-device
```
You will find multiple files in the folder, go to the [modules](#modules) section for an overview on each file.

### Dependencies
To make the FrED work, you need to install some libraries in the Raspberry Pi: (@TODO by Edu team)

### Collaborating
If you wish to collaborate in making this code better first make sure to have a GitHub account, and set it up in the terminal:
```bash
git config --global user.name "your_username"
git config --global user.email "your@email.address"
```

The GitHub CLI package provides the most lightweight setup for GitHub in the Raspberry Pi, install it with the following commands by the [official guide](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md):
```bash
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
	&& wget -qO- https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install gh -y
```
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

Now you can login with your GitHub account in the Raspberry Pi ([official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart)):
```bash
gh auth login
```
Follow the screen prompts, selecting `Github.com` for login, and `HTTPS` as the method. Select to open a browser window and login with your account. The browser will ask for a 8 letter code that is currently showing in the terminal.

Now select the branch with your name or issue you are working on, so the code changes can be uploaded to the repository:
```bash
git checkout <your name>
```
**Break things**. You can change the code as you wish, don't worry if something breaks as the safe and working version will always be available at `main` branch. To upload your local changes to the online repository, run in the terminal:
```bash
git add .  # Add your changes to staging phase
git commit -m "Concise message with the changes made"  # Package all the current changes to be uploaded
git push  # Upload to the online repo
```

When you have a **working** new feature, bug fixed, or style changes, go to the browser in your computer, open this repo, enter the **Pull requests** tab, and click **New pull request**.

There you can select your branch as the `compare`, and keep `main` as the base. Type **very detailed** instructions of your change and **Create** it.

Wait for a reviewer to check the change, and you'll receive an email notification if it has been approved or if you have to make modifications.
For smoother review process aim to make **small pull requests**.

### `database.py`
This module handles data storage and CSV file generation for the FrED device. It stores raw data, such as temperature readings, diameter readings, and motor speeds, and generates a CSV file with the collected data. The module also provides functions for retrieving and updating calibration data from a YAML file.

#### Methods:
- `generate_csv(cls, filename: str) -> None`: Generate a CSV file with the data.
- `get_calibration_data(field: str) -> float`: Get calibration data from the yaml file.
- `update_calibration_data(field: str, value: str) -> None`: Update calibration data in the yaml file.

### `extruder.py`
This module controls the extrusion process of the FrED device. It manages the heater and stepper motor for the extruder, including temperature control using a thermistor and PID control. The module also provides functions for setting microstepping modes and stepping the motor in a given direction.

#### Methods:
- `get_temperature(cls, voltage: float) -> float`: Get the average temperature from the voltage using Steinhart-Hart equation.
- `set_microstepping(self, mode: str) -> None`: Set the microstepping mode.
